    "# Telegrapher's Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The telegrapher's Equations are used to describe the votlage and/or current on the electrical transmission line as a function of distance and time. They were formulated when Oliver Heaviside developed the transmission line model in the 1880's. ([Source][wiki]) We will be using these equations to numerically model a second-order in space and second order in time problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Derivation\n",
    "When creating a transmission line model in electrical engineering, it is helpful to assume that that the cable is inmperfectly insulated, as no two conductors can be perfectly insulated due to the current flow between them. That leads to two assumptions:\n",
    "* Capacitance (C) is relevant\n",
    "* Current Leakage (Conductance, G) is relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "The wire itself will also imply some: \n",
    "* Resistance (R) in the wire\n",
    "* Inductance (L) in the wire\n",
    "    \n",
    "From these assertions, the wire can be modeled as follows ([Source][wiki]):\n",
    "\n",
    "![Model From Wikipedia [wiki]](Transmission_line_element_svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the image above, the following model arises:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\gamma}{\\partial x^{2}} = LC\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\gamma}{\\partial t^{2}} + (RC+GL)\\frac{\\partial\\gamma}{\\partial t} + RG\\gamma \\tag{1}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma \\implies i(x,t), v(x,t)$ with $i(x,t)$ and $v(x,t)$ being the functions of the current and voltage, respectively. Another way to derive the equations is to ignore the Resistance and Conductance from the begining of the model. which will lead you to the following equations: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{gather}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left[v(x,t)\\right]=-L\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left[i(x,t)\\right]\\tag{2}\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left[i(x,t)\\right]=-C\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left[v(x,t)\\right]\\tag{3}\n",
    "\\end{gather}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A more in-depth derivation can be found [here][deriv] and [here][deriv2].\n",
    "\n",
    "For lossless transmission, we can say that the losses due to an current leakage and internal resistance go to zero. That is: \n",
    "* $ R \\rightarrow 0$\n",
    "* $ G \\rightarrow 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplifies Equation 1 to: $$\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\gamma}{\\partial x^{2}} = LC\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\gamma}{\\partial t^{2}}\\tag{4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which then breaks down into either of the following two equations for voltage and current, respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{gather}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}}\\left[v(x,t)\\right] = LC\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial t^{2}}\\left[v(x,t)\\right]\\tag{5}\\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}}\\left[i(x,t)\\right] = LC\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial t^{2}}\\left[i(x,t)\\right]\\tag{6}\n",
    "\\end{gather}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Equations 2 and 3 can also become Equation 5 or 6 by using mixed partials, as shown [here][deriv2].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boundary Conditions\n",
    "When inspecting Equations 5 or 6, the question arises: why should we expect different results for the the current and voltage? The answer lies in the boundary conditions (and only defining the boundary condition for one of the equations)!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Voltage - $v(x,t)$\n",
    "Voltage boundary conditions will be Dirichlet conditions, in that both ends of our wire segment will have a fixed voltage potential. It will be this potential that drives the current in a single direction (though the current will be of opposite sign to the voltage function). For our purposes, we will say that our wire segment is grounded at both ends. That is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v(0,t) = v(l,t) = 0\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "over domain/wire-segment-length $l$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also need two intial conditions, one of which will be Dirichlet and the other will be Neumann. For our cases, since the voltage is fixed, it won't change in time, so the Neumann initial condition implies: $$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}[v(x,0)] = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dirichlet condition is some arbitrary value that would be determined by the system upstream (such as a battery or a transformer). Allow $v(x,0)\\equiv\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion based upon [this source][vol-bc].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current - $i(x,t)$\n",
    "Instead of trying to define boundary conditions and solving Equation 6, we can use either Equation 2 or 3 to find the current. This is because the same boundary conditions apply to the system. This, however, is outside the scope of this document, and is left as a \"Dig Deeper\" assignment for the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discretization\n",
    "From our discussion of Boundary Conditions above, we know that the only equation we have to numerically solve is Equation 5. So let's inspect it for clues on the discretization scheme. Here's Equation 5 again: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}}\\left[v(x,t)\\right] = LC\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial t^{2}}\\left[v(x,t)\\right]\\tag{5}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Second order in space, so we can use a central difference scheme\n",
    "* Second order in time, so we can use a central difference shcheme here as well\n",
    "* Since everything is second order, we will have to use the second order Neumann Approximation (Dirichlet conditions are order-independant).\n",

    "\n",
    "From the two plots, we can see that the numerical solution we have derived does approximate the graph. Another thing to note is that because of that arbitrary constant in front of the solved solution, the amplitude of the solution is somewhat arbitrary, unless it is defined by some other constraint. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, this constant is simply set as 1 in order to eliminate from consideration. While this is completely reasonable, it also avoids a real fact, that the there are an infinite amount of solutions to the math problem, while the actualy physical system will generally only have one solution at a given time (some of the parameters used to deterimine the constant could be perterbations or microscopic deformities in the material that the model doesn't consider).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, while mathematically sound, it may not be the best idea to ignore the arbitrary constant when modeling a physical system. If you do, the only real validation you have is whether the model shapes match up with expected shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to note is the negative values seen in the numerical solution. These can be atributed to the higher order terms that we neglected, which could allow those terms to be positive. \n",
